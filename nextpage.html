<p>History Of The Cruisers

The cruiser is a style of motorcycle in the US that was popularized during the 1930s. They did make their way in to the subsequent decades after and remained popular ever since. Some were built by Harley Davidson and others by Indian and Excelsior.

The design is very compact and old world. It’s rugged and dense, which makes it look like it can take a lot of punishment. The riding position on the cruiser allows you to place your feet forward and hands up. The spine can be erect or can lean back slightly.

Typically, cruisers emphasize on easy rideability and shifting, with a lot of low end torque. However, Cruisers don’t normally have a lot of horsepower. Those that do sport a lot of power are called Power Cruisers.</p>
